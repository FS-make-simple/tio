=== tio v1.7 ===

Changes since tio v1.6:

 * Changed escape key from ^g to ^t

   After renaming to "tio" it makes sense to change the escape key
   accordingly. Hence, the new escape key is ^t.

   Meaning, in session, its now ctrl-t + q to quit.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fixed silly "tio or tio" in man page

 * Fixed typo
