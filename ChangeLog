=== tio v1.6 ===

Changes since tio v1.5:

 * Renamed "gotty" to "tio"

   Renamed to "tio" because it is shorter and this new name also more
   precisely reflects what the program is - a simple TTY terminal I/O
   application.

   "tio" can be considered short for terminal I/O or TTY I/O or a
   combination of the two, whichever you prefer.

   Also, wanted to avoid naming conflicts with other projects.
