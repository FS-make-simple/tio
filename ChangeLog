=== Go TTY v1.5 ===

Changes since Go TTY v1.4:

 * Added log feature

   Added "--log <filename>" option which writes all activity to specified
   file.

 * Add support for configurable bash completion path

   Rewrote the configure script to support the following options:
   
   --with-bash-completion-dir=PATH
   --without-bash-completion-dir

Jakob Haufe:

 * Don't hardcode path for bash completions

   Instead, use pkg-config to find out where the completions should go.
