=== tio v1.8 ===


Changes since tio v1.7:

 * Fixed enablement of compiler warnings

 * Fixed log_open() prototype

 * Fixed index error wrt ctrl-t detection

 * Fixed handling of ctrl-t

   Before, when exercising the quit key sequence (ctrl-t + q) the ctrl-t code
   (0x14) would be sent.

   This is now fixed so that it is not sent.

   However, in case it is needed to send ctrl-t to the device it is possible by
   simply repeating the ctrl-t.

   Meaning, ctrl-t + ctrl-t = ctrl-t sent to device.

 * Improved error handling

   Fixes a memory leak and avoids aggressive busy looping when problems
   accessing tty device.

 * Removed redundant log_close() call

 * Enabled compiler warnings

Jakub Wilk:

 * Stopped copying arguments to fixed-size buffers

   Don't needlessly copy command-line arguments into fixed-size buffers.

   Previously the program crashed if an overlong pathname was provided on
   the command line. Also, some systems (such as GNU Hurd) don't define
   MAXPATHLEN at all.

 * Added const to log_open() prototype

 * Completed the ^g to ^t transition

   In 72a287f18995 the escape key was changed from ^g to ^t, but some
   code and comments still referred to the old key.

 * Used HTTPS for tio.github.io

 * Man page beautification

 * Bumped date in man page

 * Improve man page formatting

   Use regular font for metacharacters such as "[]", "," or "|";
   use italic font for metavariables.

 * Fixed hyphen vs minus vs em-dash confusion in man page

   - prints as hyphen;
   \- prints as minus sign;
   \em prints as em-dash.


Changes since tio v1.6:

 * Changed escape key from ^g to ^t

   After renaming to "tio" it makes sense to change the escape key
   accordingly. Hence, the new escape key is ^t.

   Meaning, in session, its now ctrl-t + q to quit.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fixed silly "tio or tio" in man page

 * Fixed typo
