=== tio v1.12 ===

Changes since tio v1.11:

 * Consolidated command key handling

 * Moved delay mechanism into separate function

 * Retired obsolete usleep()

   Replaced with nanosleep()

 * Added simple tx/rx statistics command (ctrl-t s)

   To display the total number of bytes transmitted/received simply perform the
   'ctrl-t s' command sequence.

   This feature can be useful when eg. trying to detect non-printable
   characters.

 * Further simplification of key handling

   Changed so that the "ctrl-t ctrl-t" sequence is now simply "ctrl-t t" to
   send the ctrl-t key code. This is inspired by screen which does similar
   to send its command key code (ctrl-a a).

   This change also allows to easier add new key commands if needed.

   Updated man page accordingly.

 * Cleaned up and simplified key handling

Jakub Wilk:

 * Insert output delay only if something was output



Changes since tio v1.10:

 * Enabled large file support (LFS)

   Added autotools AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to support 64 bit file size handling.

 * Updated tio title



Changes since tio v1.9:

 * Introduced lock on device file

   Tio will now test for and obtain an advisory lock on the tty device file
   to prevent starting multiple sessions on the same tty device.

 * Updated AUTHORS

Jakub Wilk:

 * Treat EOF on stdin as error



Changes since tio v1.8:

 * Cleanup of error handling

   Introduced consistent way of handling errors and printing error messages.

   Also upgraded some warnings to errors.

 * Updated localtime() error message

 * Cleanup

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fix error handling for select()

   Previously the error handling code for select() was unreachable.

 * Removed unneeded quotes from AM_CFLAGS

 * Expanded tabs

 * Fixed setting "tainted"

   Set "tainted" if and only if any character was read from the device.

   Ctrl-t is no longer sent to the device on exit, so the trick to avoid
   its echo is not necessary.

   Characters read from stdin don't directly affect output, so they
   shouldn't enable "tainted".

 * Used \r in color_printf()

   \033[300D is an unusual way to move the cursor back to column 1.
   Use straightforward \r instead.

 * Added missing \r\n to warning messages

   \n alone is not enough, because the terminal is in raw mode.



Changes since tio v1.7:

 * Fixed enablement of compiler warnings

 * Fixed log_open() prototype

 * Fixed index error wrt ctrl-t detection

 * Fixed handling of ctrl-t

   Before, when exercising the quit key sequence (ctrl-t + q) the ctrl-t code
   (0x14) would be sent.

   This is now fixed so that it is not sent.

   However, in case it is needed to send ctrl-t to the device it is possible by
   simply repeating the ctrl-t.

   Meaning, ctrl-t + ctrl-t = ctrl-t sent to device.

 * Improved error handling

   Fixes a memory leak and avoids aggressive busy looping when problems
   accessing tty device.

 * Removed redundant log_close() call

 * Enabled compiler warnings

Jakub Wilk:

 * Stopped copying arguments to fixed-size buffers

   Don't needlessly copy command-line arguments into fixed-size buffers.

   Previously the program crashed if an overlong pathname was provided on
   the command line. Also, some systems (such as GNU Hurd) don't define
   MAXPATHLEN at all.

 * Added const to log_open() prototype

 * Completed the ^g to ^t transition

   In 72a287f18995 the escape key was changed from ^g to ^t, but some
   code and comments still referred to the old key.

 * Used HTTPS for tio.github.io

 * Man page beautification

 * Bumped date in man page

 * Improve man page formatting

   Use regular font for metacharacters such as "[]", "," or "|";
   use italic font for metavariables.

 * Fixed hyphen vs minus vs em-dash confusion in man page

   - prints as hyphen;
   \- prints as minus sign;
   \em prints as em-dash.



Changes since tio v1.6:

 * Changed escape key from ^g to ^t

   After renaming to "tio" it makes sense to change the escape key
   accordingly. Hence, the new escape key is ^t.

   Meaning, in session, its now ctrl-t + q to quit.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fixed silly "tio or tio" in man page

 * Fixed typo
