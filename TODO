 * Split I/O feature

   Allow to split input and output so that it is possible to manage these independently.

   The general idea is to redirect the output stream on the socket port number
   specified but then redirect the input stream on the same port number + 1.

   Example:

   tio /dev/ttyUSB0 --socket inet:4444,split-io

   Will result in output stream being hosted on port 4444 and input stream hosted on port 4445.

   For file sockets something similar can be arranged:

   tio /dev/ttyUSB0 --socket unix:/tmp/tio-socket-0,split-io

   Will result in output stream being hosted via /tmp/tio-socket-0 and input stream hosted via /tmp/tio-socket-0_input
